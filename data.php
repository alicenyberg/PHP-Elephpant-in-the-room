        'title' => 'TACO-PARMESAN',
        'content' => '
        INGREDIENTS:<br>
        1 jalapeño<br>
        1 handful cilantro<br>
        5 garlic cloves<br>
        juice of 2 limes<br>
        juice of 1 orange<br>
        2 tablespoons vinegar<br>
        2 tablespoons Worcestershire<br>
        1/2 cup olive oil<br>
        1 tablespoon brown sugar<br>
        1 tablespoon cumin<br>
        1 tablespoon salt<br>
        1 teaspoon pepper<br>
        2–3 pounds flank steak<br>
        corn or flour tortillas<br>
        red onion<br>
        <br>
        DIRECTIONS:<br>
        Blend marinade ingredients together until smooth. Place the steak in a large bowl or dish, cover with the marinade, and let rest in the fridge for 1-8 hours (4 hours is pretty ideal).<br>
        Prep your other toppings!<br>
        Preheat grill to medium heat. Remove meat from marinade and discard remaining marinade. Sprinkle with salt and pepper on both sides. Place steak on grill (it should sizzle!) and grill for 7-9 minutes per side, flipping just once. When a meat thermometer reads 140-145, remove from grill and cover in foil. Let it rest for 5 minutes and boom: perfect medium rare. Grill to 155/160 for medium.

        'title' => 'FISH-TACO',
        'content' => 'INGREDIENTS:<br>
        1 large jalapeño <br>
        1 cup cilantro leaves<br>
        1/4 cup green onions<br>
        1/4 cup oil<br>
        1/4 cup Greek yogurt<br>
        1/4 cup water<br>
        1/2 avocado<br>
        1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
        2 lbs. firm white fish like cod<br>
        1 cup flour (see notes)<br>
        1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons cornmeal<br>
        1/4 cup cornstarch<br>
        1 teaspoon chili powder or spicy seasoning<br>
        1 teaspoon baking powder<br>
        1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
        1 cup light beer, such as Corona<br>
        1 egg, beaten<br>
        vegetable oil for frying<br>
        12 flour or corn tortillas<br>
        cilantro for topping<br>
        Cotija cheese for topping<br>
        <br>
        DIRECTIONS:<br>
        Puree all the jalapeño sauce ingredients in a food processor until your desired consistency is reached. <br>I sometimes add a little more oil or water at the end to make the sauce less gloppy and more drizzle-able.
        Pat the fish dry with paper towels and cut into 2-3 inch pieces. <br><br>Put 1/2 cup flour in a shallow bowl and set aside. In a separate bowl, whisk 1/2 cup flour, cornmeal, cornstarch, chili powder, baking powder, and salt. <br>Add the beer and the beaten egg; stir until combined to form the batter.
        <br>Pour enough oil in a frying pan so that the fish will be partially submerged while frying. <br><br>Heat the oil until a drip of water sizzles across the top. Dip each piece of fish in the plain flour, then the batter, then transfer to the hot oil. Fry on each side for 3-5 minutes or until golden brown and crispy. Remove from the frying pan and transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil. Sprinkle with salt while still hot; let cool slightly.
        <br>Arrange your tacos with a few pieces of fish, cilantro, Cotija cheese, and jalapeño sauce. Yummy!',
